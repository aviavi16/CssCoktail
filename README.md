## About the Project
I created a stunning cocktail glass using **pure CSS** to participate in a coding contest. The challenge was to design a glowing cocktail using only HTML & CSS—no images or SVGs allowed! ✨

## Features
- **Pure CSS design** (no images, no SVGs)
- **Glow effects** for a neon-style look
- **Smooth animations** for realism
- **Creative garnishes** for extra flair


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with keyframes & box shadows for glowing effects)

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aviavi16/CssCoktail.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser

## Why This Project?
This project was built for a contest where developers had to create a glowing cocktail using only CSS. The winner receives a **luxury hotel night worth 1,200 ILS!**
